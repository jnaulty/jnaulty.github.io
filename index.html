		<div id="description">
			I have a BA in Cognitive Science. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science">Cognitive Science</a> is an interdisciplinary field studying human cognition and involves research in the fields of: Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Computer Science. My main interests are in the studies of changes in neural networks caused by exercise and nutrition.
			I am an active club member for the Cognitive Science Student Association (CSSA) and am a co-facilitator for the Berkeley Review of CogSci Articles (BROCA) DeCal at Cal.
                        I am also a n00b at everything and frequently hAcK large databases. My "friends" call me a "script kitty" but what do they know? One day when I was playing some COD, I got a triple headshot... You won't even believe how gr8 my KDR is.

			I enjoy many outdoor activities. I was born and raised next to the ocean so I love everything water related,and I was raised in the heart of Northern California's beautiful Redwood forest. Almost every outdoor activity I have learned from my twin brother, Kirk. He has been a huge influence in bringing the outdoors into my life. Some of the things my brother has taught me are:

	<div id="future_title">Future Goals</div>
	<div id="future_content"> After graduation I plan on continuing my pursuit of studying the mind via Brain-Machine Interfaces. I aim to integrate computers with the mind to help make mindful practices more accessible, and trainable, to everyday people. I believe that with the help of biofeedback devices, people will be able to gain a better sense of their bodies' condition. Increasing awareness of one's own body can help with decisions regarding one's health. Integrating machines into the process allows for data collection, which can be interpreted by oneself, along with one's physician, to get a better understanding of one's health in real-time. I am currently looking for institutions involved in this form of research. </div>

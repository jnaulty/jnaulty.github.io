					<div class="post_title">The MindFlex Hack</div>
					<div class="post_author">John Naulty</div>
					<div class="post_content">My first EEG hack involved a $25 toy from Amazon. This was my first time 'hacking' something. Although I'm not sure if it can be called hacking since I followed a step-by-step tutorial on this site. This was the first time I had used an Arduino and the C++ language. The steps were clear and in about an hour or so I had the 'hacked' neurosky chip reading my brain. Although I do not use it as much, the visualization of my brainwaves on this device in Processing made me continue to investigate further into Mobile EEG devices. </div>

					<div class="post_title">Emotiv Hack</div>
					<div class="post_author">John Naulty</div>
					<div class="post_content">My second EEG device involved a $300 portable EEG from emotiv. The emotiv EPOC includes everything one would need to start collecting raw data....Actually it does not. The emotiv EPOC has the potential to be a great device with a huge social impact in Cognitive Therapy and the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT) movement. However, the emotiv company has made acessing the raw EEG data a very hard task. Fortunately, one much more experienced at cracking security protocols was able to extract the raw EEG data without any emotiv SDK software. Currently I am working with Bill Prinzemetal in testing the capabilities of the device with scientific rigor.  </div>

					<div class="post_title">OpenBCI Development</div>
					<div class="post_author">John Naulty</div>
					<div class="post_content">My third EEG device I have the fortune to work with was donated to the Cognitive Technology Group by Conor Rossumano, the co-founder of OpenBCI. I have been fortunate enough to work and play with the device. Currently I am collecting data for an SSVEP comparison report between the Emotiv EPOC and the OpenBCI v2 board. </div>
